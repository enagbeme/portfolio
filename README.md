# Enoch's Personal Portfolio (Next.js Version)

This repository contains the Next.js re-implementation of Enoch's personal portfolio website, originally built with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. The goal of this project was to replicate the original portfolio's design, content, and functionality using modern web technologies, specifically Next.js with TypeScript.

## Features:
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.
- **Dynamic Content:** Displays personal information, education, skills, work experience, and projects.
- **Client-Side Interactivity:** Includes scroll effects for the header and a scroll-to-top button for enhanced user experience.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Leverages Next.js for optimized performance and fast loading times.
- **TypeScript:** Ensures type safety and improves code maintainability.
- **Netlify Deployment Ready:** Configured for easy deployment to Netlify.

This project serves as a demonstration of migrating a traditional server-rendered application to a modern, performant Next.js framework.
